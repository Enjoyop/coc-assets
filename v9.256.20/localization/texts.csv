"TID_FAQ_TITLE_SHIELD","What is the Shield and how does it work?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_SHIELD","The Shield prevents other people from attacking you for a long period of time. You lose the shield when the time runs out, and attacking other villages makes it run out sooner. When your village is destroyed by an enemy attack, you automatically get a new shield for at least 12 hours. You can also purchase longer lasting shields from the shop."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_DESTROYED","What happens when a Shield or Guard runs out?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_DESTROYED","If you do not have an active Shield or Guard and you exit the game, your village will be vulnerable to attacks from other players. The attacking player will be able to steal some of your resources, but never all of them. You can protect your village with defensive buildings, walls and traps, or by buying more Shield or Guard from the shop. Terrain obstacles and the edge of the map do not stop attacking units!"
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_CLAN","How do I join or create a clan?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_CLAN","In order to join a clan, you must first rebuild the Clan Castle. Once it's rebuilt, you can tap it and choose to join or create a clan. The Clan Castle can also house reinforcement troops and spells from your clanmates. Troops garrisoned inside the Clan Castle will defend your village. Reinforcement troops and spells can also be used to attack other players."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_RECRUIT","How do I get more people into my clan?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_RECRUIT","You can invite your Game Center and Facebook friends to your clan or invite people from global chat.\n\nIn order to invite your Facebook or Game Center friends, your friend must first play Clash of Clans, connect to Game Center or Facebook with their account and have rebuilt their Clan Castle. After this, you can see your friend in the Friends menu, where you can tap their name and choose Invite from the context menu. Inviting from global chat works in a similar way: tap a player's message, and choose Invite from the context menu."
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_RECRUIT_ANDROID","You can invite your Google Play and Facebook friends to your clan or invite people from global chat.\n\nIn order to invite your Facebook or Google Play friends, your friend must first play Clash of Clans, connect to Google Play or Facebook with their account and have rebuilt their Clan Castle. After this, you can see your friend in the Friends menu, where you can tap their name and choose Invite from the context menu. Inviting from global chat works in a similar way: tap a player's message, and choose Invite from the context menu."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_RESET","Can I reset the game and start again from the beginning?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_RESET","At the moment it's not possible to restart your game. However, you can start a new game on any device that doesn't have a previous game of Clash of Clans on it."
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_RESET_ANDROID","Resetting the game is not recommended. If you 'Uninstall' the game (or clear the game's data from an app manager), you will lose all progress. IMPORTANT: To prevent accidentally losing your progress, please use Google Play Sign-In to safeguard your village. After you have used Google Play Sign-In once, you will always get your village back by signing in with the same account."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_CONTROL","How can I control my units in battle?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_CONTROL","Once placed on the battlefield, your troops are autonomous and cannot be controlled once they are deployed. At the moment of deployment, each unit's first target is highlighted with crosshairs. Different units will attack according to their abilities and their preferred targets. Check each unit's info in the Barracks' Train Troops screen, and check different defensive turrets' info as well to learn which units they target."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_TROOPS","What happened to the troops that survived the battles?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_TROOPS","After combat, all troops deployed on the battlefield turn back into Elixir and soak into the earth.\n\nExpending troops to win battles is at the heart of strategy in Clash of Clans. Think of your troops as resources to be spent wisely. You should plan every battle carefully and try to use the right number of the right type of troops. Throwing all your troops to combat without considering the cost versus benefit can lead to a Pyrrhic victory, where you end up spending more resources than you gained."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_BUYING","I am unable to buy gems, there is no option in the game?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_BUYING","Make sure that your device is set to allow in-app purchases. Go to Settings - General - Restrictions and check that In-App Purchases is set to ON. Then quit and restart the game: push the Home *(square) button on your device twice; tap and hold the Clash of Clans icon until it starts wobbling; tap on the upper-right red icon, push Home again, relaunch Clash of Clans and you should be able to buy gems."
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_BUYING_ANDROID","Make sure that you are using a valid Google account and that your primary payment method is up to date. You can check this on your personal Google Wallet page. If you have questions about payment methods or canceled orders, please contact Google directly."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_LOSTGEMS","I have just purchased gems but they never came through. What can I do?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_LOSTGEMS","While most of the transactions go smoothly, sometimes an answer from the payment provider or our servers might be slower than usual or might result in errors. Please wait some time and see if they will arrive. If this doesn't help, quit and restart the game. Your gems should be credited to you.\n\nIf this doesn't help, please contact us via the \qReport an issue\q button below."
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_LOSTGEMS_ANDROID","Most orders go smoothly, but sometimes it can take a while before our servers receive confirmation of your order. Just hang in there a little longer, the gems should arrive soon. If they don´t, try quitting and restarting the game. If you still do not have them, please check the status of your order in your Google Wallet."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_CLANSCORE","Why is my clan's score smaller than all members' combined scores?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_CLANSCORE","Clan Score is calculated using a formula that uses weighted scores from all clan members. It is not the sum of all members' scores. The Clan Score is designed to allow a more competitive and fair clan ranking."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_REPLAY","Why aren't battle replays available?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_REPLAY","There's a limit to how many replays can be stored in the game system at once, so it's a good idea to watch them as soon as possible. Replays can also become unavailable after a game update or maintenance."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_MULTIACCOUNT","Can I play multiple accounts on a single device?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_MULTIACCOUNT","Clash of Clans supports only one account per device."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_MULTIDEVICE","Can I connect multiple devices to the same account?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_MULTIDEVICE","You can play one game on multiple devices, but be sure to login to Game Center with the same account on each device. Logging into Game Center links your village to that Game Center account, and allows you to load your game on any device."
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_MULTIDEVICE_ANDROID","Yes! First make sure you have connected your village to your Google account using the Google Play Sign-In. You can then load up the same village on other Android devices by connecting to the same Google Play account via the in-game settings."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_TEXTSIZE","Can I increase the text size?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_TEXTSIZE","The text size cannot be increased, but for the best Clash of Clans gameplay experience, we recommend playing with a current or recent generation iOS device, starting with iPad 2, iPhone 4 or iPod 4th Gen.\n\nThe game also works on older devices, but the gaming experience might not be optimal."
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_TEXTSIZE_ANDROID","Unfortunately, at this time the text size cannot be increased, but we are always working on improving the gaming experience, readability and usability included."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_CHANGENAME","Can I change my village's name?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_CHANGENAME","Sorry, you can't change the name of your village. Your villagers wouldn't know where they live!"
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_DISCONNECTED","I was disconnected and lost trophies. Can you return them to me?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_DISCONNECTED","If you lost trophies due to disconnection, you were either attacked or your own attack was cut short and you lost. Because of the scoring system used in Clash of Clans, we cannot return your trophies under any circumstances. This is because each trophy you lose is actually transferred to another player, and we cannot give you new trophies without unbalancing the ranking system.\n\nTo prevent loss of trophies due to network problems, we recommend that you attack other players only when you have a stable connection (preferably WiFi)."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_TROPHIES","How does the trophy system work?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_TROPHIES","When attacking or being attacked by other players, you will gain or lose trophies depending on the outcome of the battle. The number of trophies you stand to gain or lose depends on the how successful the attack or defense has been. Beating an opponent with a higher amount of trophies than you will earn you more than winning someone with fewer trophies."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_MATCHMAKING","How does ''Find a match'' work?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_MATCHMAKING","Player vs. player matchmaking is based only on the number of trophies you have, not your experience level or league. This means that you can attack or be attacked by players who are within the same trophy range as you. We keep this range wide enough to make sure you can always find a village to raid."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_SPELLS","What are Spells and how can I use them?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_SPELLS","In order to use spells, you must first upgrade your town hall to level 5. This unlocks a new building called Spell Factory. Spell Factory works quite similarly to Barracks. You can create the potions needed for spells in the factory, but there is a limit how many you can store at once. Upgrading the Spell Factory unlocks new spells and allows you to store more spells for combat.\n\nSpells can only be used when attacking other players. You can cast the spells similarly to how you deploy troops in the battle. Just select the spell from the bar at the bottom of the screen and tap where you want to cast it. Unlike troops, spells can be casted anywhere on the playfield."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_UPGRADES","How do I upgrade my buildings?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_UPGRADES","You can upgrade your buildings by tapping on them and choosing the \qUpgrade\q option. Upgrading your Town Hall unlocks new buildings and allows you to upgrade your existing buildings even further!\n\nBuildings will not work while they are being upgraded. This means that Mines and Elixir Collectors won't generate resources and Cannons and Towers won't shoot enemies while being upgraded."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_CHATBAN","I was banned from the global chat. What can I do?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_CHATBAN","Please wait for the ban to expire. Do not contact the support because of this as support cannot affect the ban."
"TID_FAQ_TITLE_HEROES","What are the Hero units and how do I use them?"
"TID_FAQ_TEXT_HEROES","Once you upgrade your town hall to a high enough level, you will be able to recruit Heroes from the shop menu. Heroes can attack enemy villages or guard your village in case of attack.\nHeroes are immortal but can be injured and must be healed. You can heal your hero by letting him sleep or by using the Heal button."
